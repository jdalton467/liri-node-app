# liri-node-app

A neat terminal application that lets users skim information about their favorite movie, song , or Twitter account.

This app requests information from the Twitter, Spotify, and OMDb APIs and displays it to the user from the terminal.

If the user wants to find out info about their favorite song, then they can simply type node liri.js 'spotify-this-song' 'livin on a prayer'

Want to find out who directed the Titanic? Just type node liri.js movie-this Titanic

Recieve the latest 20 tweets from your favorite celebrity by writing node liri.js my-tweets

It's a fun app that can display a wealth of information! This was an exercise in performing GET requests with Ajax calls and learing how to work with different APIs
